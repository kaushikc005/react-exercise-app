# Getting Started with Create Vite 


 This project was bootstrapped with [Create Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/).

With NPM:

```bash
$ npm create vite@latest
```

With Yarn:

```bash
$ yarn create vite
```

With PNPM:

```bash
$ pnpm create vite
```

Then follow the prompts!

You can also directly specify the project name and the template you want to use via additional command line options. For example, to scaffold a Vite + Vue project, run:

```bash
# npm 6.x
npm create vite@latest my-vue-app --template vue

# npm 7+, extra double-dash is needed:
npm create vite@latest my-vue-app -- --template vue

# yarn
yarn create vite my-vue-app --template vue

# pnpm
pnpm create vite my-vue-app --template vue
```

You can use `.` for the project name to scaffold in the current directory.

## Community Templates

create-vite is a tool to quickly start a project from a basic template for popular frameworks. Check out Awesome Vite for [community maintained templates](https://github.com/vitejs/awesome-vite#templates) that include other tools or target different frameworks. You can use a tool like [degit](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit) to scaffold your project with one of the templates.

```bash
npx degit user/project my-project
cd my-project

npm install
npm run dev
```
